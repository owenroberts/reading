A cataloging app for reading.

Will share instructions for cloning/installation for use on Heroku server when I figure out how to do it myself.


To do:
- Instructions for installing for use and development.
- Ability to create new attributes.
- ~~User authentication.~~ Using http auth instead.
- Mobile styles.
- Delete references and references need to get deleted when books are deleted.
- Also "book doesn't exist page" if for some reason database gets modified outside program.
- Create custom styles and save them.
